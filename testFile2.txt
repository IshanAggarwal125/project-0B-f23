My primary goal as a CST ambassador is to communicate with prospective students. Furthermore, I am responsible for ensuring that if a student were to enroll at temple his or her on boarding process is done efficiently.

As a software testing intern my goal was to analyze code, test code and optimize code. I was also responsible for implementing best coding practices into the project, as well as adapting the code in line with technical requirements.
